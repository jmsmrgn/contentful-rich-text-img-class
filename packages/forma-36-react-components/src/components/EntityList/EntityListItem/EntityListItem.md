# EntityListItem

The EntityListItem component is used to represent lists of entities (entries and assets).

## When to use

This component should be used in combination with the EntryList component which wraps it. It differs from existing EntryCard/AssetCard components as it's intended use is for lists of entities, not individual ones.
