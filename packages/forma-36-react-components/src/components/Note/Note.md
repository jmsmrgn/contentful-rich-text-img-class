### Usage

Notes draw the users attention to a circumstance relevant to an action they're performing or a screen they're accessing. Don't confuse notes with notifications, which appear as feedback after a user has performed an action.

### Variations

Notes can be used in 3 different variations, depending on the nature of the information that's being revealed to the user:

- primary (blue)
- positive (green)
- negative (red).
