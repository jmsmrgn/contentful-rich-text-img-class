### Usage

Dropdowns contain a set of links that would take up too much space if shown as regular text links or buttons. The trigger to open a dropdown can be anything, though it has to be obvious and indicate that a dropdown menu will open when clicking it.

### Variations

#### Basics

A dropdown always contains at least 2 or more links. Links can be disabled, active, and have a hover state.

#### Optional elements

- A title can be used to clarify the purpose of a dropdown.
- Any other pattern, like a button or a text link (in the example) can be added to the dropdown as far as space allows. It doesn't have a hover state like the links.

#### Groups

A visual separation can be introduced to group a set of links or other elements. Optionally titles can be used to clarify the purpose of a group.

#### Placement

A dropdown can be placed left or right aligned to the trigger, and it overlaps the trigger by 2px. If there's not enough space below the trigger the dropdown is placed above it.

#### Size

The width of a dropdown is determined by its widest element. It has a maximum width of 420px though. An elements that takes up more space than that is cut off.

The maximum height is determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on the content of the dropdown.
