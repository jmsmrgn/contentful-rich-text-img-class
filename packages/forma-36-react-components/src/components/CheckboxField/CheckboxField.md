We're using native checkboxes (the mockup just acts as an example).
For the label, 2 different styles can be used, depending on the context and importance one wants to give to the checkbox:

- Medium weight label
- Regular weight label

When attaching a help text to a checkbox, the medium label has to be used to ensure that there's enough contrast.
